#  FUTURE IDEAS
# ==============================

# Recipe Progression
# Wood x3 -> Plank
# Plank + Resin -> Treated Plank
# Treated Plank + Magic Dust -> Enchanted Plank
# Stone x3 -> Brick
# Brick + Iron Bar -> Reinforced Brick
# Reinforced Brick + Magic Dust -> Enchanted Brick
# Fiber obtained from cotton plants, plants and soil are found in plains as well as some animals

# Potentially add a global inventory storage as well that contains only weapons/armor or quest items
# Add rarity/tiers for items (can be obtained through gatcha or buying from merchants/traders or quests/dungeons)
# Combat should be RTS when exploring.
# Cards should have travel time in this case. (Possibly rotate the cards to during this to be perpendicular to path.
# Cards should have a visible dashed line for their path as well as dashed outline for their final destination.
# Could add class system 
	# level up system 
	# magic system.
# Could also add a research system for new crafting recipes 
	# or obtained from merchants/traders
	# or through quests/dungeons
# Gods/Goddesses are related to each gacha banner, need to get favors with them to unlock their gacha banner.
# Eventually add different attack types currently only "melee" add ranged/magic later on.
# Multicard structures (Big Card Buildings). Rituals for statues.
# Add loot drops to enemy cards.
# Praying to the statue of a god/goddess is how you get research ideas for items.
